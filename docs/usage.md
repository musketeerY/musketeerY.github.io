## Categories

There are 4 main categories:

- Tools
- Resources
- CTF platforms
- Operating Systems

Each one has a dedicated page and sub-categories.

## Navigable table of content

Once you have chosen a main category, for example `Tools`, you will be able to choose a sub-category and navigate to it by clicking one.

## Rich tables

You can take a look at the [features](https://inventory.raw.pm/features.html#tables) page to watch animated video.

Once you chose a sub-category, for example `Web Application Exploitation`, you can see a table listing web app exploitation tools.

But this table is not a simple table, it is a smart one.

### Sort

By clicking on a column header (ex: name, description, language, etc.) you can sort all items alphabetically (or in the reverse order) if you sorted the `Name` column or grouped by `Programming language` if you clicked on that column.

### Search

Then on `Name` and `Description` column header, you can click on the little funnel, that will allow you to search an expression.

On this screenshot, I searched for **proxy**.

### Filter

On some columns like `Price`, `Online` or `Programming language`, you can filter the table to display only rows are empty, non empty or matching a specific value.

It is very useful, for example, if you want to display only tools coded in **Go**.
