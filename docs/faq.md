## There are already a lot of security related lists, why another one?

That's true, especially *Awesome* lists, but there is one for pentest, one for CTF, one hacking, one for web hacking, etc... I wanted one unique source with all kind of security related contents: tools, hardware, skills, resources, formations, etc...

Multiple lists made it hard to find information and there was redundancy. Also I wanted a more well structured, organized and complete list.

For more information check the [home page](https://inventory.raw.pm/index.html) of the inventory.

## What motivated you to write this inventory?

Because I was upset to see that a lot of people think there is only *CTFd* as CTF platform, that *Kali Linux* is the only pentesting distro, that *IDA Pro* is the only disassembler, etc... but there is a lot more alternatives and even better ones in most cases.
